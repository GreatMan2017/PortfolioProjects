Project 1: SQL Data Exploration for Covid-19 Analysis

Description:

This project involved conducting an in-depth data exploration and analysis of Covid-19 data using SQL Server. The main objective was to gain insights into various aspects of the pandemic, including cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations. The data, obtained from 'https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths', ensured the accuracy and credibility of the analysis. 

The exploration process employed a range of SQL techniques such as joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types. It began by examining the relationship between total Covid-19 cases and total deaths, providing valuable insights into the likelihood of mortality if one contracts the virus in their country or continent. Additionally, the analysis focused on the proportion of the population affected by Covid-19, comparing the total cases with the population size.

To enable a more detailed examination, the data was further categorized by continent, allowing for continent-specific insights. This breakdown revealed continents with the highest death count per population, as well as those with the highest infection rates relative to their populations. Furthermore, a view was created to store the explored data, serving as a valuable resource for future visualizations and in-depth analysis.

In summary, this SQL data exploration project demonstrated proficiency in SQL Server and showcased the ability to manipulate, aggregate, and analyze Covid-19 data effectively. The findings and insights obtained contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact, supporting data-driven decision-making and informed policy formulation.
