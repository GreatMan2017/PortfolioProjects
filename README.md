Project 1: SQL Data Exploration for Covid-19 Analysis


Description:
This project involved performing comprehensive data exploration and analysis of Covid-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server. The main objective was to gain insights into the impact of Covid-19 on various factors such as cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations. The exploration was conducted using a variety of SQL techniques, including joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types.

The exploration process started by examining the relationship between total Covid-19 cases and total deaths, providing valuable insights into the likelihood of mortality if one contracts Covid-19 in their country or continent. Additionally, the analysis delved into the proportion of the population affected by Covid-19 by comparing the total cases with the population size.

To enhance the analysis, the data were further categorized by continent, allowing for a more detailed examination of the impact of Covid-19 across different regions. This breakdown facilitated the identification of continents with the highest death count per population, as well as continents with the highest infection rates compared to their respective populations.

To facilitate future analysis and visualizations, a view was created to store the explored data. This view serves as a valuable resource for generating meaningful visualizations and conducting further in-depth analysis.

Overall, this SQL data exploration project showcases strong skills in SQL Server, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis. The project's findings and insights provide a comprehensive understanding of the Covid-19 pandemic's impact, enabling data-driven decision-making and informed policy formulation.
